## Readings

* Modernes Projektmanagement (German)<br/>
  Holger Timinger
  + Brief but sufficient overview about traditional and agile project management. Great when it comes to mixing both...
* Functional Programming in Kotlin<br/>
  Marco Vermeulen, Rúnar Bjarnason, and Paul Chiusano
  + FP explained on kotlin, it is also _very_ interesting to compare it to the scala version of the book (Functional Programming in Scala, Second Edition)
* AI as a Service<br/>
  Peter Elger, Eóin Shanaghy 
  + Deploy real-world AI models in production with minimal effort thanks to modern public cloud infrastructure


### Former Readings

* Mastering Akka<br/>
  Christian Baxter
  + Good overview about the Scala/Akka Universe. Excellent for understanding DDD, Event Sourcing, and CQRS.
* Grokking Deep Learning<br/>
  Andrew W. Trask
  + This is THE book you want to read as absolute beginner.
* Deep Learning and the Game of Go<br/>
  Max Pumperla and Kevin Ferguson
  + Great book with you really want to understand the technology behind AlphaGo and AlphaGoZero.
* Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On<br/>
  Maxim Lapan
  + A great, intermediate-level book that give you up-to-date details about implementing Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch. Also covers the maths behind learning very well.
* Mastering Ansible<br/>
  Jesse Keating
  + Good introduction into using ansible as DevOpt tool. I read the second edition (but the new third editions seems to be even better). However, it does not cover extending ansible as it is rather a book for beginners.
